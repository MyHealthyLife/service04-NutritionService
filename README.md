# Nutrition Service

This service provides some useful tools to retrieve different foods to organize the meals of the user, in order to have a correct caloric intake. Every food has a type, so to organize every food set in the service and be able to retrieve easily certain type of foods. For instance, the service can be used from the upper layers to provide balanced daily meals by searching for foods that can provide more or less energy for the activities the user just made. This service exposes a series of methods to read and update the sentences (and their types) through a SOAP interface.
